                            <p>
                            Ridley was founded in 1997. Since its inception, Belgium's largest bicycle manufacturer has been firmly at the forefront of product innovation. 
                            Its first innovative development was the conical headset, which was introduced in 2001 on the Ridley Damocles bike. 
                            This development subsequently became the standard in the bike industry. 
                            Since then, Ridley continues to astonish technologically with aerodynamic road bikes and gravel bikes.

                            <p>
                            We are providers of balance, with a mission to enable children to find their own balance by living a joyful experience and a unique adventure with every getaway. 
                            BEMOOV children's bikes are therefore based on lightness, ergonomics, fun, durable quality, and of course, safety. 
                            Why? A child’s body shape is totally different from that of adults and yet, many children's bikes are not designed with this in mind. 
                            Instead, they are just adult’s bikes that have been made smaller. 
                            At BEMOOV, we have studied and adapted the geometry of each child's bike, chosen a high-quality lightweight aluminum for the frame and rims, light and comfortable and strong saddles, specially designed brakes and gearshifts… In short, we’ve addressed everything you need to have fun and learn balance without hurting yourself.

                            <p>
                            Crono is one of the world’s finest manufacturers of cycling shoes. 
                            The company was founded in 1973 by Giancarlo Stocco, but it really made its mark in the 1980s, 
                            when cyclists and triathletes like Timo Bracht embraced the brand’s shoes. 
                            Crono cycling shoes developed a reputation for comfort and resilience, leading many cycling teams to add them to their kit. 
                            Crono cycling shoes are characterised by a commitment to craft production and technical quality, 
                            every pair of shoes is made in Italy according to strict production standards, 
                            and they also include innovative technologies such as BOA fit systems which ensure total comfort and even pressure.
                            That’s a recipe for a pure riding experience, wherever your desires take you.
